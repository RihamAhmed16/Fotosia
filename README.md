A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

The Fotosia application designed using Flutter provides an easy and seamless user experience for sharing photos and videos. The application features a modern and visually appealing design, with a user interface that allows for easy navigation and access to various features such as feeds, stories, direct messages, and more. Users can also edit their photos and videos with a range of filters and effects before posting them.

In addition, the application has advanced features such as facial recognition and object detection, which can be used for tagging people or identifying objects in photos. The application also supports real-time comments and likes, making it easy for users to interact with their followers and friends.
